    <h2 class="heading-text">Description</h2>
    <p>Khinkali are typically filled with meat and a bit of liquid so they are in fact soup dumplings. They have handles
        – called kudi (კუდი), which actually means “tails” – to help you eat them properly.</p>
    <p>They are special and truly one of our favorite foods. And now we cook khinkali on nights when we are happy,
        nights we are sad, and nights we crave khinkali.</p>
